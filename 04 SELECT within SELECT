5. Percentages of Germany
# SELECT name, CONCAT(ROUND(population/(SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany') * 100), '%')
# FROM world
# WHERE continent = 'Europe'
* Decimal places: You can use the function ROUND to remove the decimal places.
* Percent symbol %: You can use the function CONCAT to add the percentage symbol.

6. Bigger than every country in Europe
# SELECT name
# FROM world
# WHERE gdp > ALL (SELECT gdp
                   FROM world

7. Largest in each continent
# SELECT continent, name, area
# FROM world AS x
# WHERE area >= ALL(SELECT area
                    FROM world AS y 
                    WHERE y.continent = x.continent AND area > 0)
                  
8. First country of each continent (alphabetically)
# SELECT continent, name
# FROM world AS x
# WHERE name <= (SELECT name
                 FROM world AS y
                 WHERE y.continent = x.continent)
                 
** Difficult Questions **

9. ** Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. **
   ** Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. **
   ** Show name, continent and population. **
# SELECT name, continent, population
# FROM world AS x
# WHERE 25000000 >= ALL(SELECT population
                        FROM world AS y
                        WHERE y.continent = x.continent)
                        
10. ** Some countries have populations more than three times that of any of their neighbours (in the same continent). **
    ** Give the countries and continents. **
# SELECT name, continent
# FROM world AS x
# WHERE population > ALL(SELECT 3 * population
                         FROM world AS y
                         WHERE y.continent = x.continent AND y.name <> x.name)
