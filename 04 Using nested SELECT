1. Using SELECT in SELECT
# SELECT name
# FROM world
# WHERE continent = (SELECT continent 
                     FROM world
                     WHERE name = 'Brazil')

2. Multiple Results
# SELECT name, continent
# FROM world
# WHERE continent IN (SELECT continent 
                      FROM world
                      WHERE name='Brazil' OR name='Mexico')
                      
3. Subquery on the SELECT line
# SELECT population/(SELECT population
                     FROM world
                     WHERE name='United Kingdom')
# FROM world
# WHERE name = 'China'

4. Operators over a set
# SELECT name
# FROM world
# WHERE population > ALL (SELECT population
                          FROM world
                          WHERE continent='Europe')
